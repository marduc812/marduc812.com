  TLDR;

<div>
  If you like to spend some time on customising, use <strong>Dirty Unicorns</strong>.
</div>

<div>
  If you want something stable but not Stock use <strong>Pure Nexus</strong> with <strong>Elemental X</strong> kernel.

  Nexus devices have always been, in my opinion, until the release of Nexus 6, the best Value for money option. What I like the most is that they are pure Android without any Samsung or LG apps. Having a Nexus is like a responsibility to &#8220;play&#8221; with it. And what I mean by playing is actually customising. Starting from a simple Launcher and some Themes to custom ROMs and Kernels.

A really good ROM is of course <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/" target="_blank">CyanogenMod</a>. CM was my main ROM for more than two years. I liked CM with all the nightlies and everything, but I get easily bored. So I also installed <a href="http://repo.xposed.info/module/de.robv.android.xposed.installer" target="_blank">Xposed Framework</a>. Installing Gravity Box from Xposed, gives a lot of options that could probably find preinstalled on CM, but not on of the most basics for me, Data indicator.

My next stop was <a href="http://dirtyunicorns.com/" target="_blank">Dirty Unicorns</a>. A really good ROM, looking A LOT like CM, probably because they also use CM Theme Engine. Recently there was an update on their Tweaks and it gives you a lot of new customisations on your Status Bar, Navigation Bar that I loved it. If you want to spend some time customising your phone, this is the best ROM I have tried.

Since Dirty Unicorns, I also tried <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6/orig-development/kernel-franco-kernel-r1-t2987173" target="_blank">Franko kernel</a> with Stock ROM, and <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/google-nexus-5/development/rom-cataclysm-nexus-5-t2518660" target="_blank">Cataclysm</a> with <a href="http://elementalx.org" target="_blank">Elemental X</a> kernel. My final destination is <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6/development/rom-pure-nexus-project-t3148214" target="_blank">Pure Nexus ROM</a> with Elemental X kernel. Pure Nexus has a really good customising base, and you can either use Layers ( I use layers) or CM Theme Engine. Pure Nexus is completely stable  and battery life is good (Never had a problem with my battery). Of course I don&#8217;t use DT2W, because in that case battery would be really shorter. Finally I think there are a lot of ROMs that you should probably try even once, and that it is really difficult to find exactly what we need.

Feel free to share your favourite ROM.

#### Nougat ROM Update 11/16

There are some Nougat ROMs, and from curiosity I tried the [7.0 version of Pure Nexus][1] with [Elemental X 7.0.4 Kernel][2]. I actually had <del>no problem except from some </del> a few problems. One of theme are some small bugs that made the screen freeze for about 5 seconds. Also on Google Camera Video Recording there are some green frames appearing randomly, while recording, so I used [Footej Camera][3] that I found great. As a conclusion I suggest you flashing a previous version,  or even better way a little bit more if you don&#8217;t want to have any issues.
