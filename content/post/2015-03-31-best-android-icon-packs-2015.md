I change my phone&#8217;s icons and themes all the time, and I have some favourite icon pack and themes also. Since I&#8217;m running <a href="http://localhost/category/cyanogenmod/" target="_blank">CyanogenMod</a> 12, there is a huge amount of themes and icon packs to use. Even if your phone is stock you can use a launcher. The best choice for me is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher&hl=en" target="_blank">Nova Launcher</a>, and you could buy <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher.prime&hl=en" target="_blank">Nova Launcher Prime</a> that costs 3.00€ but gives you some great features.

&nbsp;

#### 1. Bliss &#8211; Icon Pack

[1.69€ | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BladeXDesigns.Bliss&hl=en" target="_blank">Link</a>]

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-393" src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bliss-icon-pack.jpg" alt="bliss icon pack" width="1000" height="400" />][1]

I like the cartoonized look of the icons. At the moment it has 1250 icons and great wallpapers to combine with. Supports most of the launchers (APEX, NOVA,GO,NEXT,TSF Shell, ADW, ACTION PRO, HOLO) and you can contact the designer for any requests. Very important is that he publishes weekly updates for the icons.

&nbsp;

#### 2. Cryten &#8211; Icon Pack

[0.69€ | Link]

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-394" src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/cryten.jpg" alt="cryten icon pack" width="1000" height="400" />][2]

One of the most downloaded icon packs. Those circle icons are great for every wallpaper with colours. This icon pack has more than 50.000 downloads and for sure worth it. At the moment it has around 3.100 icons and some great wallpapers and has weekly updates. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Vertumus&hl=en" target="_blank">Vertumus</a> has some more icon packs that worth taking a look (most of them are paid).

&nbsp;

#### 3. DAB Icon Pack

[1.59€ | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xonyxinc.icon.dab&hl=en" target="_blank">Link</a>]

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-395" src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DAB-icon-pack.jpg" alt="DAB icon pack" width="1000" height="400" />][3]

DAB is a circle icon pack. All icons are well designed and at the moment has 1.100 icons. It supports every launcher like the most but it seems like it doesn&#8217;t offers weekly updates, since it&#8217;s latest update was about 4 months ago.

&nbsp;

#### 4. Moonshine Icon Pack

[Free | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nexbit.icons.moonshine&hl=en" target="_blank">Link</a>]

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-397" src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/moonshine-icon-pack.jpg" alt="moonshine icon pack" width="1000" height="400" />][4]

The best icon pack for Material wallpapers and material style themes. It offers 900 vector designed icons. I used to have it for a long time and for sure it&#8217;s one the bests. Supports all launchers and Muzei Wallpaper.

&nbsp;

#### 5. Numix Circle Icon Pack

[Free | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.numix.icons_circle" target="_blank">Link</a>]

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-398" src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/numix-icon-pack.jpg" alt="numix icon pack" width="1000" height="400" />][5]

Numix is the best free circle icon pack. It doesn&#8217;t has as many icons as other circle paid packs, but all it&#8217;s icons have perfect matching colours and the 500.000 downloads prove it.

&nbsp;

#### 6. Flair Icon Pack

[1.58€ | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xonyxltd.icon.flair&hl=en" target="_blank">Link</a>]

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-401" src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/flair-icon-pack.jpg" alt="flair icon pack" width="1000" height="400" />][6]

Flair has material design and more than 500 icons. At the moment does not look complete, but all it&#8217;s icons are carefully designed. What I don&#8217;t like is the fact that doesn&#8217;t has weekly updates and for icon requests, uploader asks for a donation.

&nbsp;

#### 7. Glim Icon Pack

[1.85€ | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.icons.glim&hl=en" target="_blank">Link</a>]

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-402" src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/glim.jpg" alt="glim icon pack" width="1000" height="400" />][7]

Glim has more than 2.200 icons and supports really a lot apps. Costs 1.85€ but in stead of other apps has no app purchase that means you buy the whole pack. Offers Material and Flat wallpapers and the most important has weekly updates. This is for sure an icon pack I would buy and not regret.

&nbsp;

#### 8. Switch UI Icon Pack

[1.14€ | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.launchertheme.kxnt.switchui&hl=en" target="_blank">Link</a>]

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-403" src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Switch-UI-Icon-Pack.jpg" alt="Switch UI Icon Pack" width="1000" height="400" />][8]

Most of icon pack I like are circle but this square icon pack is wonderful. Following the Material design with the falling shadow. Gets updated weekly and has more than 1.300 icons. What I didn&#8217;t like is the app purchase option for requests and more.

&nbsp;

#### 9. Glyph Icon Pack

[Free | <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/android/themes/icons-pack-glyphs-tokems-t3019186" target="_blank">Link</a>]  
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-404" src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/glyph-icon-pack.jpg" alt="glyph icon pack" width="1000" height="400" /> 

My favourite white icon pack inspired by iPhone icons. It&#8217;s free and fits perfectly with dark but also and light blurry wallpapers. Best FREE icon pack to keep your phones home screen as minimal as possible. It doesn&#8217;t has than many icons but for sure will make your home screen look cool.

&nbsp;

Do you prefer free or paid icon packs? What&#8217;s your favourite?
