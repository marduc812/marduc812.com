Like every year during black Friday, companies publish new offers to attract people. We are used to see offers every year by services like `pastebin`, `shodan` but not this year. Shodan did an one day offer of 1$ for a lifetime registration, a few days ago to celebrate 10 years. Pastebin also didn’t do any offer this year so far, but luckily more offers appeared.

Bellow a table can be found like last year’s post, with all the network security deals that run this year.

I would like to see an offer on [BurpSuite](http://localhost/2019/01/21/burp-suite-battle-royale-edition/) since it is such a great tool and I will definitely go for a VPS and probably VMware. Also PIA is a great option, but I bought it a long time ago and use it daily.

What is the offer that you would go for?
