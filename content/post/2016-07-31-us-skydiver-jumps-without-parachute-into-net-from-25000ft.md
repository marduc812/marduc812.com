American Luke Aikins has become the first person to jump from 25,000 ft (7,620m) without a parachute, landing safely in a net.  
Mr Aikins &#8211; who has more than <!--more-->18,000 jumps under his belt &#8211; fell dead centre into the 100x100ft net in Simi Valley, southern California.

  
During the two-minute fall aired live on Fox television, the 42-year-old reached the speed of 120mph (193km/h).  
To loud cheers, he climbed out of the net and hugged his wife and young son.

&#8220;I&#8217;m almost levitating, it&#8217;s incredible,&#8221; he said after Saturday&#8217;s jump.  
&#8220;This thing just happened! I can&#8217;t even get the words out of my mouth,&#8221; he said, admitting that he was nervous beforehand.

He also admitted that he had nearly had to cancel the jump because he was ordered to wear a parachute for safety and this would have made his landing more dangerous because of the extra weight.  
However, the organisers had lifted the ban just minutes before the jump.  
&#8220;Aikins&#8217; leap represents the culmination of a 26-year career that will set a personal and world record for the highest jump without a parachute or wing suit,&#8221; his spokesman Justin Aclin said.  
Mr Aikins, who is a safety and training adviser for the US Parachute Association, said his friend came up with the idea two years ago.
