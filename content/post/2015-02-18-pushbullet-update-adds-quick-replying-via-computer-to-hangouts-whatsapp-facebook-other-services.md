Pushbullet issued an update this morning that brings even more phone-to-computer-back-to-phone-again integration, similarly to how their previously introduced SMS-reply function works. <!--more-->In the latest update, the Pushbullet team added direct replying via computer to your Hangouts, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, and Line messages. So now, when messages from those apps arrive on your phone, you can reply quickly through Pushbullet on your computer.

The new feature requires Android 4.4 “Kit Kat” and higher. Also, in order to reply to Hangouts messages, you will need the Android Wear app installed. I know that that probably sounds odd, but it’s required even if you don’t own an Android Wear device. In fact, you don’t even have to run the app, just install it.

Finally, the update also introduces a new single button widget that allows you to turn notification forwarding on or off.

To see the new reply-all feature in action, check out the clip below.
