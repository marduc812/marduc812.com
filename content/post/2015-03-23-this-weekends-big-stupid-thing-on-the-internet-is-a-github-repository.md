Tearing up the internet right now is some dude&#8217;s wan extended dick joke in the form of a Github repository called <a href="https://github.com/letsgetrandy/DICSS" target="_blank">​DICSS</a>. It&#8217;s a bunch of stupid attempted puns smashed together in the form of a <!--more-->JavaScript project promising &#8220;directly injected CSS.&#8221; Lulz include attempts at fourth-grade boy humor like &#8230;

> ( ({})<=8 ) {
> 
> // yeah, you get it&#8230;

> DICSS keeps on growing! Some popular DICSS add-ons include

> COCSS (cross-origin DICSS),
> 
> SECSS (security enhanced DICSS)
> 
> *DICSS-Pics (DICSS plugin for working with images)
> 
> Circum-Sizer (calculate the circumference of a rounded element in CSS)

It goes on like that across several files.

In ​a comment thread attached to the project, a GH user pointed out, &#8220;You guys seem to think this is funny. But it&#8217;s really not. It&#8217;s harmful to the developer community.&#8221;

And so a familiar battle ensued (is ensuing) between the internet&#8217;s legion of man-boys and those who man-boys like to call &#8220;SJWs&#8221; (for &#8220;social justice warriors&#8221;). The SJWs seem to think that Github should be a neutral platform for programmers to collaborate on projects and remotely store their git repositories, while the man-boys think it should be a safe place to be all sweaty and uncomfortable to be around.

Can you even believe it?

Some commenters have suggested that the project makes light of sexual violence. Its read-me file contains the line, &#8220;And please, never force someone to use DICSS if they&#8217;re not willing,&#8221; which is an amazing indicator of just how tone-deaf and deluded this whole crowd is. A line meant to disclaim the creepiness of the joke that winds up being one of the creepiest lines in the whole thing! That&#8217;s impressive.

The standard retort in said comment thread is that said line proves without a doubt that the joke is in fact very female-friendly. Because putting someone in any kind of situation or circumstance where it might be wise to reassure them that &#8220;hey it&#8217;s cool I&#8217;m not going to rape you&#8221; is totally cool so long as you say the magic words.

Whatever. It&#8217;s creepy-dude humor, which is Family Guy humor: winks, leers, barf. And, yeah, this is not dissonant with the pre-existing tone with the developer world—the JavaScript/front-end developer world in particular (sorry bros!).

Business Insider UK interviewed the project&#8217;s creator, Randy Hunt (user &#8220;letsgetrandy&#8221;) ​because someone had to. Hunt brushed off the criticism in the usual way: &#8220;People want to be offended. It&#8217;s reverse privilege.&#8221; Reverse. Privilege.
