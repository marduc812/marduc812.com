Microsoft has started an ominous countdown timer on many Windows 7 and Windows 8 systems, highlighting the fact that upgrading for free to Windows 10 will no longer be possible from<!--more--> this Friday.

The deadline, in the UK at least, appears to be set at 11:59pm on Friday 29th – the screen capture above was taken today – Wednesday 27th at around 6:10pm, pointing to free upgrades being available right until the last minute.

The OS was launched on July 29th, 2015 and as of June this year had gained just over 19% market share according to www.netmarketshare.com. After this Friday, you’ll likely have to purchase the OS, whether you have a genuine copy of Windows 7 or Windows 8 or not, and there’s a possibility Microsoft may even move to a subscription model – something it’s already doing for business customers.

You don’t have to upgrade permanently, though, to register and keep your free install. All you have to do is upgrade and roll back and you’ll be able to upgrade in the foreseeable future for free too.

You can see my full guide on how to upgrade for free and also how to roll back to Windows 7 in the article below:
