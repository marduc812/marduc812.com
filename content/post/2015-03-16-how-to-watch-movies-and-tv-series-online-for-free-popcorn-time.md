When you want to watch a movie you either buy, watch it on cinema or download it. You can now stream a movie instantly, with this great app. What the app does is <!--more-->download the torrent file and stream it. But only that. There are options for the resolution you want to have 720/1080 for movies and 480/720/1080 for series.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-358" src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-16-at-12.14.45-PM.png" alt="popcorn time " width="900" height="541" />][1]You can also stream series and anime you can change sorting options, but this isn&#8217;t over yet.

You can select the subtitles you want to stream and you can also play it at VLC and not at Popcorn Time player it self.  I want to stream Big Hero 6 for example in 1080 with Greek subtitles.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-357" src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-16-at-1.32.30-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-16 at 1.32.30 PM" width="900" height="537" />][2]

&nbsp;

Here you can have the basic options like Resolution, IMDB rating, a small description of the movie, watch the trailer of the movie, select subs and to bookmarks, in general everything you need for a movie.

Every movie I tried so far works great with the subs being perfectly synced.

Popcorn Time is available for Mac, Windows, Linux and Android.

> ## Is this legal?

> Depends on where you&#8217;re from, really. Once again: we&#8217;re using torrents, so if you really care, you&#8217;d better google what the legal situation around this protocol is where you live.
