  Hal Lasko, who was better known as Grandpa, worked as a graphic artist back when everything was done by hand. His family introduced him to the computer and Microsoft Paint long after he retired.

  Grandpa would spend ten hours a day moving pixels around his computer paintings. His work is a blend of pointillism and 8-Bit art.
