I have been away from my home for about 2 weeks and here you can find almost nowhere a place to have Internet connection. Even if you find, speed is so slow that you want to kill yourself, although<!--more--> data speed is great. I have H+ almost all the time. I have a Nexus 5 and I was making a hotspot so I could surf a bit. It was able to connect to the hotspot but still there was no Internet connection. Solution came by downloading 

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mstream.easytether_beta&hl=en" target="_blank">Easy Tether Lite</a>.

You can create a hotspot and transfer data through via USB or bluetooth. In my case because bluetooth is not compatible I used USB and everything was working great except the fact that I couldn&#8217;t visit websites with https://. So what I has to do is to use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mstream.etpc&hl=en" target="_blank">Easy Tether PRO</a>.

It costs 7.73€ but it&#8217;s clearly the best to make you phone hotspot with everything and you can surf as much as you want.
