Prisma, the turn-your-photos-into-paintings app that’s been blowing up over the past few weeks, is now launching on Android in full form. That means you no longer need a beta invite, and can download it straight off the Google Play Store.<!--more-->

The app has only been available in beta form on Android for about five days, so this is a surprisingly quick turnaround. Then again, Prisma probably wants to take advantage of its current momentum as much as possible – especially amid rumors it might be acquired.  
Of course, Prisma is far from the first app to try to make your photos look like painted or drawn artwork. The difference here is its use of artificial intelligence makes the images look much more like they were created by actual humans than a simple algorithms.  
Prisma’s co-founder shared some stats about the app in the short time it’s been available:

  * Over 400 million photos have been ‘prismed’
  * It’s been downloaded over 10.6 million times on iOS alone
  * The are over 1.55 million daily active users
  * Daily downloads maxed out about 700k

The Android app has all the same features as the iOS version, including over 30 filters and support for either taking a new photo or choosing existing ones from your gallery.

Video support – which the company has already demo’d – will launch in about “a week or so.” Prisma tells us live video support is also planned for the near future, but isn’t ready to provide more specifics.

Interestingly, Prisma says it’s going to delete the least popular styles “while adding a lot of cool new ones.” Some people will likely be sad to see some filters go, but we’d rather have a gamut of high-quality filters, so kudos to Prisma for cutting the weight.
