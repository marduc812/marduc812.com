About a year ago I first rooted my phone. My first android phone was a Nexus 5 ( which I still own) and I think this is a process that will probably make your phone better but for sure cooler. I made a list with the best &#8220;tweaks&#8221; <!--more-->I use and like the most. I will update the list with new apps every time I find something worth sharing. They appear in random order.

&nbsp;

1. **GravityBox** [<a href="https://github.com/GravityBox/GravityBox" target="_blank">Github</a> | <a href="http://repo.xposed.info/module/com.ceco.kitkat.gravitybox" target="_blank">Free</a> | <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/app-gravitybox-v3-1-5-tweak-box-android-t2554049" target="_blank">XDA Dev</a>]

Probably the best app to modify your status bar, your lock screen everything you want. Change battery style, change location of time, color of status bar, transparency and customise your phone just like you want it to be. You can view the full source code of this great app at their Github repo page.The only thing that I don&#8217;t like is that there is no support for <a href="http://localhost/tag/cyanogenmod/" target="_blank">CyanogenMod</a> (most of features exist on Cyanogen&#8217;s settings, but my favourite one is missing, the data monitor).

&nbsp;

2. **SCR Screen Recorder** [ <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iwobanas.screenrecorder.free2" target="_blank">Free</a> | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iwobanas.screenrecorder.pro" target="_blank">4.99€</a> | <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2422061" target="_blank">XDA Dev</a>]

This is the best screen recording app I have used. You can use the free version that can record your screen up to 3 minutes but also adds a watermark of the app. Still I don&#8217;t believe that the watermark is the problem since this app is just GREAT. Although if you don&#8217;t want the watermark or you want to record for more than 3 minutes PRO version offers exactly what you want ,with only 4.99.

3. **Greenify** [<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oasisfeng.greenify&hl=en" target="_blank">Free</a> | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oasisfeng.greenify.pro" target="_blank">2.29€</a> | <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2155737" target="_blank">XDA Dev</a>]

Greenify is an app for rooted and non-rooted phones that solved an issue with the battery life of my Nexus 5. Battery couldn&#8217;t last almost not even a day without Greenify. Now it lasts more than 30 to 35 hours with medium usage and 4G and Bluetooth always enabled.  the Hibernate + LockScreen Widget is my new lock button. If you are facing any battery drain issue or if you don&#8217;t this app is the killer. It will make your phone work like a charm. And the 2.29 donation pack is a worth for sure.

&nbsp;

4. WifiPassword [<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farproc.wifipassword&hl=en" target="_blank">Free</a>]

This is a really simple but useful app. It won&#8217;t find your neighbours wifi password or it won&#8217;t check for passwords matching a router but it will display a simple clean list of your wifi passwords stored on your phone.

&nbsp;

5. Root Explorer [<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.speedsoftware.rootexplorer&hl=en" target="_blank">3.99€</a>]

Root Explorer is the ultimate file manager for root users. Access the whole of android&#8217;s file system (including the elusive data folder!). Features include multiple tabs, Google Drive, Box, Dropbox and network (SMB) support, SQLite database viewer, Text Editor, create and extract zip or tar/gzip files, extract RAR archives, multi-select, execute scripts, search, remount, permissions, bookmarks, send files (via email, bluetooth etc), image thumbnails, APK binary XML viewer, change file owner/group, create symbolic link, &#8220;Open With&#8221; facility, MD5, create shortcuts.
