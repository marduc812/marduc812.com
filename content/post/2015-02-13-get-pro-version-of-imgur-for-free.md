Imgur is one of the best websites for image sharing where users can rate your images and make it to the most virals at the moment. There are <!--more-->a lot other websites that do almost the same thing but for sure not with that success and not so simply. The great interface the really simple fast and smart image browsers make a success story, that those guys prefer to share with us, the users and they are doing it by giving all users Premium Features for FREE.

This is the original post they made

> On Imgur’s first birthday, we announced Imgur Pro, a paid account that gave users the ability to support their favorite image sharer while getting some cool extra features in return. Today, we celebrate Imgur’s sixth year, and we’ve decided that you’re the one who deserves a gift. We’re phasing out Pro subscriptions…and making the Pro features completely free for every Imgur user!

So what are the features that PRO users had and now all users have?

  * Store an unlimited number of images in your account
  * Receive multiple thumbnail options on all uploads
  * Access complete image analytics and referrer data
  * Manage, edit or delete any uploaded image at any time
  * Interact with the awesome Imgur community through commenting, voting and sharing

Their message continues

> It’s been an amazing six years for Imgur. What began as a simple image uploading service has transformed into a community of the Internet’s most dynamic visual storytellers. Imgur has become the best place to explore, share, and discuss the Internet’s images–and we couldn’t have done it without your support and loyalty. We’re looking forward to many more years of uniting the universe through images with you.

> Enjoy the free stuff!
