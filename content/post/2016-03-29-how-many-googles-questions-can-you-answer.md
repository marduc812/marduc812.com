Working for Google is a dream for almost everyone, cause of the great working place and great salaries. These questions are difficult to answer and they got banned for <!--more-->this reason. Here is a list of the questions and the answers of theme.

[x\_accordion\_item title=&#8221;How much should you charge to wash all the windows in Seattle?&#8221;]Answer: This is one of those questions where the trick is to come up with an easier answer than the one that&#8217;s seemingly being called for. We&#8217;d say. &#8220;$10 per window.&#8221;[/x\_accordion\_item]

[x\_accordion\_item title=&#8221;Why are manhole covers round?&#8221;]Answer: So it doesn&#8217;t fall through the manhole (when the plane ordinarily flush with the plane of the street goes perpendicular to the street.)[/x\_accordion\_item]

[x\_accordion\_item title=&#8221;How many times a day does a clock’s hands overlap?&#8221;]Answer: 22 times.[/x\_accordion\_item]

[x\_accordion\_item title=&#8221;You need to check that your friend, Bob, has your correct phone number, but you cannot ask him directly. You must write the question on a card which and give it to Eve who will take the card to Bob and return the answer to you. What must you write on the card, besides the question, to ensure Bob can encode the message so that Eve cannot read your phone number?&#8221;]Answer: Since you are just &#8220;checking,&#8221; you ask him to call you at a certain time. If he doesn&#8217;t, he doesn&#8217;t have your number. Too simple? A reader suggest: &#8220;In that case you need a check-sum. Have Bob add all the digits of your phone number together, write down the total, and pass that back to you.&#8221;[/x\_accordion\_item]
