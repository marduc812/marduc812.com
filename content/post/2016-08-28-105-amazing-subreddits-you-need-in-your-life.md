I was browsing 4chan and other boards for a couple of years, but when I found out about reddit, I just knew that this would be the one. Not only because<!--more--> of the better content management they offer, but mostly because there were thousands of categories you can browse. But what is reddit?

> Reddit (stylized as reddit, <span class="nowrap"><span class="IPA nopopups">/<span title="/ˈ/ primary stress follows">ˈ</span><span title="'r' in 'rye'">r</span><span title="/ɛ/ short 'e' in 'bed'">ɛ</span><span title="'d' in 'dye'">d</span><span title="/ɪ/ short 'i' in 'bid'">ɪ</span><span title="'t' in 'tie'">t</span>/</span></span>)<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference">[5]</sup> is a social media, social newsaggregation, web content rating and discussionwebsite. Reddit&#8217;s registered community members can submit content, such as text posts or direct links. Registered users can then vote submissions up or down to organize the posts and determine their position on the site&#8217;s pages.
