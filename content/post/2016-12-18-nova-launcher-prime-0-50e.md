The time of the year where Nova Launcher&#8217;s price falls, is here again. You can download the prime version of the world&#8217;s best launcher for just 50 cents. The features that you get by buying the prime version are listed below.

**Gestures** &#8211; Swipe, pinch, double tap and more on the home screen to open your favorite apps  
• **Unread Counts** &#8211; Never miss a message. Unread count badges for Hangouts, SMS, Gmail and more using the [TeslaUnread plugin][1]  
• **Custom Drawer Groups** &#8211; Create new tabs or folders in the app drawer  
• **Hide Apps** &#8211; Keep a clean app drawer by hiding never used apps  
• **Icon Swipes** &#8211; Set custom actions for swiping on app shortcuts or folders  
• **More scroll effects** &#8211; Such as Wipe, Accordion, and Throw

Nova Launcher is implementing more and more features from the new Pixel, while you can keep the old classic style from the AOSP Android. Don&#8217;t waste any time, just buy it.
