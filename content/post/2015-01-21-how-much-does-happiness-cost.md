People always wonder what is happiness.

The answer is here by **RomanAtwood** and his video **Crazy Plastic Balls prank**!<!--more-->



THIS IS HAPPINESS!

250.000 plastic balls on the floor of the house. Everyone loves plastic balls. Everywhere in your house to jump, fall, slide, do whatever you want on them. But how much does actually love costs?

With a search on google you can find **50k** plastic balls with **0.02 euros** per piece.

For sure if you buy more than 50k balls price will be even lower so it will be.

**250.000 x 0.02 = 5.0k euros** or less and this is a great price for happiness.

I wish I could be there!
