Youtube is such a great invention. All those videos, all those thousands of hours starring at the screen and calling your friends to show them a funny video.  All those viral videos, the &#8220;Apparently&#8221; kid, Charlie the Unicorn, Charlie bite me again etc.

User <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheDailyConversation" target="_blank">The Daily Conversation</a> made a 16 minute video with the videos that went viral since YouTube first launched in February of 2005 when a year later <a href="http://localhost/tag/google/" target="_blank">Google</a> bought it for $1.65 billion. I had seen more than 90% of those videos but for most of those I had no idea that they were so old. Take a look a the video below.
