I’ve held a few tennis balls in my life, even though I don’t play. They’re nice objects — round, bouncy and fluorescent yellow. There are also <!--more-->360 million of them made every year.

  
A lot of those come from a Wilson factory in Thailand, where Benedict Redgrove went to closely document their birth. The process turns out to be a beautiful combination of glue, yellow wool and a lot of rubber.

It’s a mesmerizing sight to behold, and very refreshing to see how things are made by focusing more on aesthetics and less on generic American voiceovers.
